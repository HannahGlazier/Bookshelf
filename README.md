# Bookshelf

### Welcome to Bookshelf!
We have created an app that allows users to seach for their favorite books or authors with the help of the Google Books API. Users can scroll through the first ten results provided by the API and in greater detail they can examine the book cover and a short synopsis of its content. Users are also able to leave likes and reviews for their favorite books!
